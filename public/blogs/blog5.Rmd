We want to study climate change and find our data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

For this particular data set, NASA clearly states that the base period is the period between 1951-1980.

We run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

First, we selected the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. 

```{r tidyweather1}

weather_1 <- weather %>% 
  select(c(Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec))

glimpse(weather_1)

```


We convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. We named the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather2}

tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  select(1:13) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, names_to = "month", values_to = "delta") 

```


## Plotting Information

We plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and added a trendline. We first needed to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 

```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather1 <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label = TRUE),
         year = year(date))

#plot the graph
ggplot(tidyweather1, aes(x = date, y = delta, color = "#FF6347")) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color = "dark blue")+
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title= "Temperature levels are on the rise",
       subtitle = "Annual temperature deviation relative to 1951-1980 base",
    caption="Source: NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies",
    x = "Years",
    y = "Temperature Deviation"
  )

```

But now we are wondering, is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? We use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line.

```{r facet_wrap}

tidyweather1 <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label = TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather1, aes(x = date, y = delta, colour = "#FF6347"))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="blue") +
  facet_wrap(~month) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature anomalies vary by month", 
    x= "Years",
    y="Temperature Deviation",
    caption="Source: NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies")

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculaltes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We removed data before 1800 using `filter`. Then, we used the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We assigned the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

glimpse(comparison)
```

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Data shows that global warming is real",
    subtitle = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    x     = "Delta",
    y     = "Density"
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we are also interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}


average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta, colour = "#FF6347"))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color = "blue") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  +
  labs (
    title = "Yearly Temperatures Levels have been increasing significantly",
    subtitle= "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    x     = "Years",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         

```

We see that yearly temperature levels have been increasing significantly over the past. Especially in recent years, we have seen a sharp rise in temperature levels. 

## Confidence Interval for `delta`

Next, we construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present. We take note that: 

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
    sd_delta = sd(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
    size = n(),
    SE = sd_delta/sqrt(size),
    tcritical = qt(0.975, size-1),
    lower_ci = mean_delta - tcritical*SE,
    upper_ci = mean_delta + tcritical*SE
  )

formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

bootstrap_delta <- comparison %>% 
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  specify(response=delta) %>%
  generate(reps =1000, type ="bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat ="mean")

infer_confidance_interval <- bootstrap_delta %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level=0.95,type="percentile") %>%
  rename("Lower" = 'lower_ci', "Upper" = 'upper_ci' ) 

infer_confidance_interval

```

The two methods yielded almost the same result: the 95% confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, is 0.92 - 1 degrees celsius.

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

The data definitely tells us that the earth has been warming at an unprecedented rate over the last decade. The warming of global climate is now unequivocal. With the analysis of the data set we showed that our planet has been getting warmer for decades. Only over the last decade the temperature increased by around 1 degrees celsius, which can have significant consequences over the next years such as extreme events, including heat waves on land and in the ocean, record rainfall and flooding, massive fires and heat-charged hurricanes.
